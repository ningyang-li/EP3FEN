**Abstract:**  
Hyperspectral classification is a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing. Recently, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved better classi-fication performances than traditional machine learning algorithms. However, be-cause of the large kernel size and spectral redundancy, the classification accuracy and efficiency of existing CNN-based methods are still restrained. In this paper, a lightweight model based on the enhanced pseudo 3D features and salient band se-lection is proposed for HSI classification. Specifically, an enhanced pseudo 3D convolution block is constructed to extract spectral-spatial features with less pa-rameters. Then, a salient band selection block without parameters is designed to relieve the spectral redundancy. To obtain the diverse spectral dependency, a lo-cal-connected layer is introduced to explore the interactions between adjacent bands. By integrating these blocks, deep spectral-spatial pseudo 3D features can be well prepared for classification. Experiments on three HSI data sets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

**Contibutions:**  
1. An end-to-end model which adopts EP3C and SBS were proposed for HSI classifica-tion, which is composed of enhanced pseudo 3D convolutional (EP3C) block, salient band selection (SBS) block, and spectral dependency capture (SDC) block.
2. EP3C block aimed to extract the spectral-spatial pseudo 3D features with efficient convolutional kernels.
3. SBS block was designed to collect the important information between neighboring bands, thereby relieving spectral redundancy.
4. SDC block adopted a local-connected layer to accurately model the spectral dependency of the center pixel.
